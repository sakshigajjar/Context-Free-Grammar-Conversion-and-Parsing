# Context-Free-Grammar-Conversion-and-Parsing
Converted a context-free grammar into Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) and implemented the CYK algorithm for string parsing. This project involved simplifying grammatical rules into CNF for efficient parsing and applying the CYK algorithm to analyze strings based on the grammar, enhancing syntax checking and language processing capabilities.
